This project implements a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization. The chatbot can recognize greetings, respond to user input, and provide feedback based on user interactions.

The chatbot implemented in this project is capable of engaging in conversations with users. It recognizes common greetings and responds accordingly. Additionally, it leverages NLP techniques to understand and respond to user input, and it can correct typographical errors in user messages using a spellchecker.
